INTRODUCTION\n\nEnterprise Technology Services (\"Applicant\") hereby respectfully submits this formal appeal pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719 and 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.723, challenging the denial of Funding Request Number 2499004159 under Application Number 241000856 for Funding Year 2024. This appeal is timely filed within the sixty (60) day period specified in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(c) from the date of the Funding Commitment Decision Letter (\"FCDL\").\n\nThe Applicant respectfully requests that the USAC Appeals Committee reverse the denial decision and approve the funding commitment for the requested Data Transmission and/or Internet Access services, as the denial was issued without sufficient basis and contrary to applicable E-Rate program rules and precedent.\n\n---\n\n## II. BACKGROUND\n\nEnterprise Technology Services is an eligible entity under the E-Rate program pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.501. The organization submitted a properly completed and timely Form 471 application for Funding Year 2024, requesting support for essential Data Transmission and/or Internet Access services necessary for educational purposes and program compliance.\n\nThe application underwent the standard USAC review process, during which the Applicant cooperated fully with all requests for information and clarification. Despite this good faith compliance and cooperation, USAC issued a denial decision that lacks adequate justification and fails to consider the totality of evidence demonstrating the Applicant's eligibility and compliance with all applicable E-Rate program requirements.\n\n### A. Nature of Services Requested\n\nThe services requested under FRN 2499004159 consist of Data Transmission and/or Internet Access services, which are Priority One services eligible for E-Rate support under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.502(a). These services are essential for providing internet access to eligible locations and supporting the educational mission of the organization.\n\n### B. Compliance History\n\nEnterprise Technology Services maintains a strong record of E-Rate compliance and has previously received E-Rate funding for similar services. The organization has established procedures to ensure ongoing compliance with all applicable program requirements, including competitive bidding, eligible use restrictions, and documentation requirements.\n\n---\n\n## III. GROUNDS FOR APPEAL\n\n### A. Procedural Due Process Violations\n\nThe denial decision violates fundamental principles of administrative due process by failing to provide adequate notice of the specific reasons for denial. The FCDL contains no specific denial comment, making it impossible for the Applicant to understand the basis for the adverse determination or to respond effectively.\n\nUnder 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(a), applicants have the right to appeal adverse funding decisions, but this right is meaningless without adequate notice of the grounds for denial. The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to provide reasoned explanations for their decisions, and the failure to do so renders the denial arbitrary and capricious. See *Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v. State Farm Mutual*, 463 U.S. 29 (1983).\n\n### B. Lack of Substantial Evidence\n\nThe denial appears to be based on an incomplete or erroneous review of the application materials. The Applicant submitted all required documentation in a timely manner and responded to all USAC inquiries. Without specific denial reasons, the Applicant can only conclude that the denial lacks substantial evidence and violates the standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.720.\n\n### C. Inconsistent Application of Program Rules\n\nThe denial decision appears inconsistent with USAC's treatment of similar applications and violates principles of equal treatment under the E-Rate program. The FCC has emphasized the importance of consistent application of program rules to ensure fair treatment of all eligible entities. See *In re Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism*, FCC 97-420 (1997).\n\n### D. Failure to Consider Mitigating Circumstances\n\nTo the extent that any technical deficiencies may have existed in the application materials, USAC failed to consider mitigating circumstances and the Applicant's demonstrated good faith efforts to comply with program requirements. The FCC has recognized that minor procedural defects should not result in denial of funding where the applicant has substantially complied with program requirements and the purposes of the rule have been served.\n\n---\n\n## IV. SPECIFIC REGULATORY VIOLATIONS IN DENIAL PROCESS\n\n### A. Violation of 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(a) - Right to Adequate Notice\n\nThe regulation requires that applicants receive adequate notice of adverse determinations. The failure to provide specific denial reasons violates this fundamental requirement and denies the Applicant due process of law.\n\n### B. Violation of 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.720 - Standards for Review\n\nThe denial fails to meet the substantial evidence standard required under this regulation. Administrative determinations must be supported by substantial evidence in the record, which appears to be lacking in this case.\n\n### C. Violation of 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.503 - Competitive Bidding Requirements\n\nTo the extent that competitive bidding issues may be at issue (though not specifically identified), the Applicant maintains that all competitive bidding requirements were satisfied, including:\n\n1. **Form 470 Posting Requirements**: Any Form 470 was properly posted for the required 28-day period pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.503(c)(2).\n\n2. **Evaluation Criteria**: Services were selected based on price and other evaluation criteria set forth in the Form 470.\n\n3. **Documentation**: All required documentation was maintained and submitted as requested.\n\n---\n\n## V. LEGAL PRECEDENT SUPPORTING REVERSAL\n\n### A. FCC Precedent on Administrative Due Process\n\nThe FCC has consistently held that applicants are entitled to meaningful notice and an opportunity to respond to adverse determinations. The failure to provide specific denial reasons violates this fundamental principle.\n\n### B. Substantial Evidence Standard\n\nFederal courts and the FCC have established that administrative denials must be supported by substantial evidence. The lack of specific denial reasons suggests that substantial evidence may be lacking in this case.\n\n### C. Good Faith Compliance Doctrine\n\nThe FCC has recognized that applicants who make good faith efforts to comply with program requirements should not be penalized for minor technical deficiencies that do not undermine the purposes of the program rules.\n\n---\n\n## VI. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION\n\nThe following documentation is attached to this appeal and incorporated by reference:\n\n### A. Required Appeal Documentation\n1. **Complete copy of the original Form 471 application and all amendments**\n2. **Copy of the FCDL denial letter dated [DATE]**\n3. **Correspondence file between Applicant and USAC**\n4. **Documentation of competitive bidding process** (if applicable)\n\n### B. Additional Supporting Evidence\n1. **Organizational eligibility documentation**\n2. **Service provider contracts and agreements**\n3. **Evidence of proper Form 470 posting** (if applicable)\n4. **Internal compliance procedures and policies**\n5. **Previous E-Rate funding history demonstrating compliance**\n\n### C. Technical Documentation\n1. **Network diagrams and service specifications**\n2. **Educational use documentation**\n3. **Technology plan excerpts** (if applicable)\n\n---\n\n## VII. REQUESTED RELIEF\n\nBased on the foregoing arguments and supporting documentation, Enterprise Technology Services respectfully requests that the USAC Appeals Committee:\n\n### A. Primary Relief Requested\n1. **Reverse the denial decision** in its entirety for FRN 2499004159\n2. **Approve the funding commitment** for the requested Data Transmission and/or Internet Access services\n3. **Issue a corrected FCDL** reflecting approval of the funding request\n4. **Process the funding commitment** in accordance with standard USAC procedures\n\n### B. Alternative Relief\nIn the alternative, if the Appeals Committee determines that additional information or clarification is needed:\n\n1. **Remand the matter** to USAC staff for reconsideration with specific instructions\n2. **Allow the Applicant to supplement** the application record with additional documentation\n3. **Conduct a telephonic or written conference** to resolve any outstanding issues\n\n### C. Procedural Relief\n1. **Establish procedures** to ensure adequate notice of denial reasons in future cases\n2. **Provide written explanation** of the basis for the original denial decision\n3. **Extend relevant deadlines** to account for the appeal period\n\n---\n\n## VIII. CONCLUSION\n\nThe denial of FRN 2499004159 lacks adequate justification and violates fundamental principles of administrative law and E-Rate program regulations. Enterprise Technology Services has demonstrated substantial compliance with all applicable program requirements and is entitled to the requested funding support.\n\nThe failure to provide specific denial reasons deprives the Applicant of due process and makes meaningful appellate review impossible. This procedural deficiency alone warrants reversal of the denial decision.\n\nMoreover, the record demonstrates that the Applicant is an eligible entity requesting eligible services through a properly conducted competitive bidding process. The requested services are necessary for educational purposes and fall squarely within the scope of services supported by the E-Rate program.\n\nThe E-Rate program was established by Congress to ensure that schools and libraries have access to affordable telecommunications and internet services. Denial of properly submitted and compliant applications undermines these statutory purposes and harms the students and communities served by eligible entities.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Enterprise Technology Services respectfully urges the USAC Appeals Committee to reverse the denial decision and approve the requested funding commitment. The Applicant stands ready to provide any additional information that may be required and looks forward to a prompt resolution of this matter.\n\n---\n\n## IX.
