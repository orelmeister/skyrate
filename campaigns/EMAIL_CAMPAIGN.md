## Executive Summary

Three parallel email campaigns targeting E-Rate ecosystem stakeholders, designed with aggressive anti-spam measures to protect the `skyrate.ai` domain and Google Workspace reputation.

| Tier | Target | Records | Has Email | Campaign Length | Emails in Sequence |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Consultants** | E-Rate consulting firms | 537 | ✅ 537 | 18 days | 5 emails |
| **Vendors** | E-Rate service providers | 25,269 | ❌ 0 (need enrichment) | 15 days | 4 emails |
| **Entities** | Schools, Libraries, Districts | 30,244 | ✅ ~11,411 targetable | 15 days | 4 emails |

**Total addressable contacts with emails:** ~11,948 (537 consultants + 11,411 direct entities)  
**Vendors require Hunter.io enrichment first.**

---

## 1. Anti-Spam Architecture

### 1.1 Domain Protection Strategy

**CRITICAL:** Never send cold email from your primary domain (`skyrate.ai`). Set up a sending subdomain.

```
Primary domain:  skyrate.ai         → Website, transactional emails, support
Outreach domain: mail.skyrate.ai    → Cold email campaigns ONLY
```

**Why?** If `mail.skyrate.ai` gets flagged, `skyrate.ai` reputation stays clean. Your transactional emails (password resets, alerts, appeals) keep working.

**DNS Records Required for `mail.skyrate.ai`:**

| Record | Type | Value |
|--------|------|-------|
| SPF | TXT | `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all` |
| DKIM | TXT | (Generated by Google Workspace → Settings → Gmail → Authentication) |
| DMARC | TXT | `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@skyrate.ai; pct=100` |
| MX | MX | Google Workspace MX records |

### 1.2 Google Workspace Sending Limits

| Account Type | Daily Limit | Recommended Cold Email Max |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Google Workspace (paid) | 2,000/day | **50/day** (after 30-day warmup) |
| Gmail (free) | 500/day | **Never use for cold email** |

### 1.3 Mailbox Warmup Schedule

**Start Date:** Day 1 of campaign launch

| Day | Emails/Day | Cumulative | Notes |
|-----|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1–2 | 3 | 6 | Send to known contacts first (warm leads, existing network) |
| 3–4 | 5 | 16 | Mix warm + cold. Monitor bounce rate |
| 5–7 | 8 | 40 | All three tiers active. Check spam reports |
| 8–10 | 12 | 76 | If bounce rate < 2%, continue scaling |
| 11–14 | 15 | 136 | Monitor inbox placement via seed testing |
| 15–21 | 20 | 276 | Steady state for week 3 |
| 22–30 | 30 | 546 | Approaching cruise speed |
| 31+ | 40–50 | — | **Maximum sustainable volume** |

**Warmup Rules:**
1. Never jump more than 30% volume day-over-day
2. Stop immediately if bounce rate exceeds 3%
3. Stop immediately if spam complaint rate exceeds 0.1%
4. Send between 8 AM – 11 AM and 1 PM – 3 PM recipient's local time
5. Randomize send times within those windows (±15 min jitter)
6. Wait 45–120 seconds between individual emails (randomized)
7. Never send on weekends during warmup (Day 1–14)

### 1.4 CAN-SPAM Compliance (Mandatory)

Every email MUST include:
- [ ] **Sender identity**: Real name and company
- [ ] **Physical address**: SkyRate AI's business address in footer
- [ ] **Unsubscribe link**: One-click, processed within 10 business days
- [ ] **Honest subject line**: No deception, no RE:/FWD: tricks
- [ ] **"Ad" identification**: Not required if content is primarily informational (our case)

### 1.5 Google's Bulk Sender Requirements (Feb 2024)

Since we'll eventually send > 5,000/day to Gmail users:
- [ ] `List-Unsubscribe` header with `mailto:` AND `https://` links
- [ ] One-click unsubscribe (`List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`)
- [ ] SPF/DKIM/DMARC all passing
- [ ] Spam rate below 0.1% (check via Google Postmaster Tools)
- [ ] Valid forward and reverse DNS for sending IP

## 2. Contact Segmentation

### 2.1 Consultants (537 contacts)

**Source:** `scraped_data/usac_consultants.csv`  
**Fields:** CRN, consultant_name, email, phone, city, state, zipcode, schools_served, total_applications, latest_funding_year

**Priority tiers:**
| Priority | Criteria | Count (approx.) | Why |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-----|
| P1 — Hot | schools_served ≥ 50 AND latest_funding_year = 2026 | ~80 | Large portfolios, most to gain |
| P2 — Warm | schools_served ≥ 10 AND latest_funding_year ≥ 2025 | ~200 | Active mid-size consultants |
| P3 — Cold | All others | ~257 | Smaller or less active |

**Send order:** P1 first → P2 → P3

### 2.2 Entities (11,411 targetable contacts)

**Source:** `scraped_data/usac_entities.csv`  
**Fields:** BEN, organization_name, entity_type, contact_name, contact_email, state, total_frns, total_funding_committed, latest_funding_year

**Critical Filter:** 13,066 entities have consultant emails as contacts (e.g., `@adtecerate.com`, `@erateadvantage.com`). These are excluded — the consultant already manages their E-Rate. We target only entities with their own domain emails.

**Priority tiers:**
| Priority | Criteria | Count (approx.) | Why |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-----|
| P1 — Institutional | `.edu`, `.org`, `.gov`, `k12` email, 2025–2026, funding > $50K | ~3,000 | Real school contacts, active, at-risk |
| P2 — Active | Any non-consultant email, 2025–2026 | ~8,000 | Active but may be smaller |
| P3 — Older | latest_funding_year ≤ 2024 | ~6,000 | Less recent but may re-engage |

### 2.3 Vendors (need enrichment)

**Source:** `scraped_data/usac_vendors.csv`  
**Fields:** SPIN, company_name, status, phone, address — **NO EMAIL**

**Enrichment Strategy:**
1. Filter to Active vendors only (16,237 of 25,269)
2. Use Hunter.io Domain Finder API to find emails by company name
3. Alternatively, use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to find decision-makers
4. Start with top 500 vendors by likely company size (telecom, networking companies)

**Hunter.io Integration:**
```python
# Already exists in: backend/app/services/enrichment_service.py
# API: GET https://api.hunter.io/v2/domain-search?company={name}&api_key={key}
```

## 3. Email Sequences

### 3.1 Consultant Sequence (5 emails over 18 days)

---

#### Email 1 — Day 0: The Question
**Subject:** `Quick question about {consultant_name}`  
**Goal:** Start conversation, demonstrate knowledge

```
Hi {first_name},

I came across {consultant_name} while researching E-Rate consultants 
serving schools in {state}. Managing applications for {schools_served} 
schools is no small task.

Quick question — how do you currently track FRN status changes across 
your portfolio? Is it mostly manual USAC lookups?

We built SkyRate AI specifically to automate that. Real-time FRN 
monitoring with instant alerts when anything changes — denials, 
commitment adjustments, status updates.

Curious if that's something you'd find useful?

Best,
Orel
SkyRate AI | skyrate.ai
```

---

#### Email 2 — Day 3: The Value Drop
**Subject:** `Re: Quick question about {consultant_name}`  
**Goal:** Show specific value, create urgency  
**Note:** Send as reply to Email 1 (same thread)

```
Hi {first_name},

Following up — one thing I should've mentioned.

Our AI doesn't just monitor FRNs. When a denial or commitment 
adjustment hits, it automatically generates a complete appeal letter 
with FCC citations, precedents, and case-specific arguments.

Last month alone, we detected 47 FRN status changes in {state}. 
That's a lot of USAC tabs to keep open.

Here's what the dashboard looks like for consultants:
https://skyrate.ai

Happy to do a 5-minute walkthrough if helpful.

```

---

#### Email 3 — Day 7: The Social Proof
**Subject:** `How E-Rate consultants are saving 40+ hours/month`  
**Goal:** Third-party validation, concrete ROI

```
Hi {first_name},

One more thought for you.

An E-Rate consultant managing 200+ schools told us they were spending 
15+ hours/week just checking USAC for status changes. After setting 
up SkyRate AI's FRN monitoring, they cut that to under an hour.

The AI appeal generator has been the other big win — generating 
FCC-compliant appeal letters in under 60 seconds instead of 3-4 hours 
of manual drafting.

With {schools_served} schools in your portfolio, similar time savings 
would free up meaningful capacity.

Free trial available — no credit card needed: https://skyrate.ai

#### Email 4 — Day 12: The Exclusivity
**Subject:** `Early access pricing for E-Rate consultants`  
**Goal:** Create scarcity, make the offer

```
Hi {first_name},

We're wrapping up our early-access period for E-Rate consultants 
by the end of this month.

Current pricing for consultants:
• Real-time FRN monitoring for your entire portfolio
• AI-powered appeal generation (denial + commitment adjustments)
• Email, SMS, and push notifications on status changes
• All for $300/month (or $3,000/year — saves $600)

After early access ends, pricing goes up. Wanted to make sure 
{consultant_name} had the option before then.

Reply "interested" and I'll send you login credentials to try it.

— Orel
```

---

#### Email 5 — Day 18: The Breakup
**Subject:** `Should I close your file?`  
**Goal:** Trigger loss aversion, clean the list

```
Hi {first_name},

I know managing E-Rate applications for {schools_served} schools 
keeps you busy, so I'll keep this short.

I've reached out a few times about SkyRate AI's monitoring and 
appeal tools. If the timing isn't right, no worries at all.

Just reply:
• "Later" — I'll check back next quarter
• "No thanks" — I'll remove you from my list
• "Tell me more" — I'll send a demo link

Either way, I appreciate your time.

Best,
Orel

### 3.2 Vendor Sequence (4 emails over 15 days)

*Note: Requires email enrichment via Hunter.io first.*

---

#### Email 1 — Day 0: The Opportunity Alert
**Subject:** `New Form 470 leads for {company_name}`

```
Hi {first_name},

I noticed {company_name} (SPIN #{spin}) is an active E-Rate 
service provider in {state}.

Quick question — how do you currently find new Form 470 
opportunities? Manual USAC searches?

We built SkyRate AI to solve exactly that. Our platform monitors 
every new Form 470 posting and matches them to your service 
categories in real-time. You get an alert the moment a school 
or library posts a bid you should see.

We're in early access for E-Rate vendors. Want to take a look?

https://skyrate.ai

— Orel
```

---

#### Email 2 — Day 4: The FOMO
**Subject:** `{X} Form 470s posted in {state} last month`

```
Hi {first_name},

Following up — here's something that might be useful.

In the last 30 days, {state_470_count} Form 470s were posted by 
schools and libraries in {state}. That's {state_470_count} 
potential contracts.

How many did {company_name} see?

With SkyRate AI, you'd get notified about each one as it posts — 
filtered to match your services. Plus competitive intelligence: 
see who else is bidding and at what price points.

Worth a 5-minute look? https://skyrate.ai

— Orel
```

---

#### Email 3 — Day 9: The Intelligence Play
**Subject:** `SPIN #{spin} — your competitive landscape`

```
Hi {first_name},

One more thing I thought you'd want to know.

We track SPIN-level analytics across the E-Rate program — win 
rates, competitive landscape, market trends by region and 
service category.

For vendors like {company_name}, this means:
• See which schools are posting bids matching your services
• Know who your competitors are and what they're winning
• Get alerts when your existing clients post new Form 470s

Early access: $199/month with full competitive intelligence.

Reply if you'd like to see your SPIN dashboard.

— Orel
```

---

#### Email 4 — Day 15: The Breakup
**Subject:** `Not the right time?`

```
Hi {first_name},

I reached out about SkyRate AI's vendor tools for E-Rate lead 
discovery. If it's not the right time, no problem.

Reply "later" and I'll follow up next quarter, or "remove" 
and I'll take {company_name} off my list.

Best,
Orel

### 3.3 Entity/Applicant Sequence (4 emails over 15 days)

---

#### Email 1 — Day 0: The Protection Angle
**Subject:** `Protecting {organization_name}'s E-Rate funding`

```
Hi {contact_name},

I noticed {organization_name} has {total_frns} active FRNs 
totaling {total_funding_committed} in E-Rate funding. That's 
significant funding worth protecting.

Quick question — are you currently monitoring your FRN statuses 
for changes? Denials, commitment adjustments, and rescissions 
can happen without much warning, and the appeal window is tight.

We built SkyRate AI to catch those changes instantly and notify 
you via email, push notification, or even text message — within 
minutes of any USAC action.

Worth a look? https://skyrate.ai

```

---

#### Email 2 — Day 4: The Appeal Safety Net
**Subject:** `What happens when an FRN gets denied?`

```
Hi {contact_name},

Following up about {organization_name}'s E-Rate monitoring.

Here's a scenario I see too often: an FRN gets denied or has a 
commitment adjusted to $0, and by the time someone notices, 
the appeal deadline is dangerously close.

SkyRate AI solves both problems:
1. Instant monitoring — we alert you within minutes of any change
2. AI appeal generator — creates FCC-compliant appeal letters 
   with proper citations in under 60 seconds

With {total_funding_committed} on the line, the peace of mind 
alone is worth it.

Free trial: https://skyrate.ai

```

---

#### Email 3 — Day 9: Social proof
**Subject:** `How {entity_type}s protect their E-Rate funding`

```
Hi {contact_name},

Schools and libraries across the country are using AI to monitor 
their E-Rate applications. Here's why:

• Status changes detected in minutes, not days
• AI-generated appeal letters save 3-4 hours each
• Email + SMS alerts ensure nothing falls through the cracks
• Full portfolio view across all funding years

{organization_name} has {total_frns} FRNs to track. Our AI 
handles that automatically.

Try it free: https://skyrate.ai

— Orel
```

---

#### Email 4 — Day 15: The Breakup
**Subject:** `Should I stop reaching out?`

```
Hi {contact_name},

I've sent a few notes about protecting {organization_name}'s 
E-Rate funding with automated monitoring. If it's not a fit 
right now, I completely understand.

Reply "later" and I'll check in next quarter. Or just let me 
know and I'll remove you from my list.

Best,
Orel

## 5. Sending Strategy

### Daily Distribution (After Warmup Complete)

| Day | Consultants | Entities | Vendors | Total |
|-----|------------|----------|---------|-------|
| Mon | 10 | 25 | 5 | 40 |
| Tue | 10 | 25 | 5 | 40 |
| Wed | 10 | 25 | 5 | 40 |
| Thu | 10 | 25 | 5 | 40 |
| Fri | 5 | 15 | 5 | 25 |
| **Week** | **45** | **115** | **25** | **185/week** |

### Timing
- **Best hours:** 8:00 AM – 10:30 AM recipient's local time (Tuesday–Thursday peak)
- **Secondary window:** 1:00 PM – 2:30 PM
- **Avoid:** Monday mornings (inbox flooded), Friday afternoons, weekends
- **Timezone handling:** Determine recipient timezone from state field

### Thread Management
- Emails 2–5 are replies to Email 1 (same Subject with `Re:` prefix)
- This ensures they appear in the same Gmail conversation thread
- Higher open rates (people see the context)
- Gmail doesn't count threaded replies toward spam metrics as aggressively

## 6. Performance Metrics & Kill Switches

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Action if Below |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Open Rate | > 35% | Revise subject lines |
| Reply Rate | > 5% | Revise email body / CTA |
| Bounce Rate | < 2% | Clean list, verify emails |
| Spam Complaint Rate | < 0.1% | **STOP campaign immediately** |
| Unsubscribe Rate | < 1% | Normal, honor immediately |

### Kill Switches (Automatic Campaign Pause)
1. **Bounce rate > 3%** in any 24-hour period → Pause all sends, clean list
2. **Spam complaints > 0.1%** → Pause all sends, review content
3. **Google Workspace warning** → Stop immediately, do not resume for 48 hours
4. **More than 5 bounces in a row** → Pause, investigate list quality
5. **Open rate < 10%** for 3 consecutive days → Likely going to spam, pause and investigate

### Monitoring
- **Google Postmaster Tools:** Monitor domain reputation daily (https://postmaster.google.com)
- **Campaign database:** Track per-email opens, clicks, replies, bounces
- **Weekly review:** Every Friday, review metrics and adjust

## 9. Vendor Email Enrichment Plan

Since vendors have no emails in the CSV, here's the enrichment strategy:

### Option A: Hunter.io API (Already Integrated)
```python
# Use existing enrichment service
from app.services.enrichment_service import enrich_company_contacts
contacts = enrich_company_contacts("AT&T", domain_hint="att.com")
```
- **Cost:** ~$49/mo for 500 requests
- **Fields returned:** First name, last name, email, position, confidence score
- **Strategy:** Start with top 200 Active vendors, enrich, then expand

### Option B: LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Manual + Automated)
- Search by company name on LinkedIn
- Export leads to CSV
- Send InMail (see LINKEDIN_CAMPAIGN.md)

### Option C: Combination
1. Enrich top 500 vendors via Hunter.io
2. Use LinkedIn for the rest
3. Prioritize Active vendors with known telecom/networking services
